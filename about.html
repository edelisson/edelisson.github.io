I made this website as a personal hub to act as an alternative to social media.<p>

This took some refamiliarizing with HTML as well as familiarizing with CSS, but all things considered I am still a novice in both of them.<br>
For learning, I have used w3schools, Rolf Staflins "HTML- & CSS-boken" (the HTML- and CSS-book) as well as a number of Youtube-videos.<br>
There are some technical errors in the source that I intend to fix, once the know-how is sharpened up.<p>

Because my field of study (archival science) generally encourages the use of open source software (for reasons I will not go into now),<br>
and because I ideologically agree with it (for the most part), I run FOSS when possible. For this website I've used ATOM,<br>
and the laptop I'm using has Linux Mint. There is a blog post <a href="february2020.html#20200209">here</a> about my migration to primarily FOSS.<p>
