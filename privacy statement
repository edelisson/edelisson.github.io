I, along with many others, are increasingly dissatisfied with platforms that breach upon personal privacy,<br>
and lay groundworks for less than mentally healthy collective spaces. The scope of it is too much to go through in just a few<br>
paragraphs, you will however be able to read more about it under <a href="links.html">Links</a> where I will continuously put up links<br>
to resources regarding these matters as they've evolved and will evolve, to the best of my knowledge. <p>

It is not an online presence per se that I am against; that would be absurd and would it have been the case, this website would not be in the making.<br>
It is however the <em>way</em> that it is currently done, that I have a real gripe with. So instead of relying on second parties with questionable data policies<br>
and shady TOS:s, I figured I would go old school and see just how far down the grassroots can be pulled out from the dirt.<p>

This took some refamiliarizing with HTML as well as familiarizing with CSS, but all things considered I am still a novice in both of them.<br>
For learning, I have used w3schools, Rolf Staflins "HTML- & CSS-boken" (the HTML- and CSS-book) as well as a number of YouTube-videos.<br>
<em>(Before you have a "gotcha!" moment, check out the open source tool FreeTube under links.)</em><p>

Actually, with that said, reaching a nirvana-like stallman-esque level of privacy shouldn't be a dichotomy of do or don't commit to privacy oriented<br>
practices. Each and every one has to make the choice of how far they are willing to comfortably go, and how long time it will take for them.<br>
<strong>I</strong> am at a place where I am more comfortable <strong>without</strong> certain social media memberships than I am <strong>with</strong> them.<br>
That was not the case three or even one year ago, but I digress.<p>

All HTML and CSS have effectively been typed out by me, even if it meant having to look at the text in a different window.<br>
I consider that a much more apt methodology of learning cognitive skill than just CTRL+C and CTRL+V.<p>
