<a name="20200207">2020-02-07: The academy awards and 2019 in film</a><p>

One of my chief interest for a number of years has been film, so much so that I am seriously considering writing my bachelor in archival science<br>
about film archives. I am not exactly a fan of the format of the academy awards - competitive elements in the cultural sphere is something I've<br>
never really recognized as unproblematically valid. But it would be a lie if I'd say I didn't get any kind of enjoyment out of it - <br>
I am not spared from a tribal mindset that makes you "pick sides" about what should "win", and certain nominated people or titles has piqued<br>
my interest in the movies and, ultimately causally made me watch them. So as such I decided to make my very own wishlist over how the awards<br>
in the categories I'm most familiar with will pan out. These are not predictions per se, but more so either what I <em>want</em> to win or what I <em>believe</em><br>
deserves to win. Here it is:<p>

  Academy Awards 2020<p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Nominees</th>
      <th>My choice</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Best Motion Picture</td>
      <td>1917<br>Jojo Rabbit<br>Joker<br>Le Mans '66<br>Little Women<br>Marriage Story<br>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood<br>Parasite<br>The Irishman</td>
      <td>1917</td>

      <td>Best lead actor</td>
      <td>Adam Driver (Marriage story)<br>Antonio Banderas (Dolor y Gloria)<br>Joaquin Phoenix (Joker)<br>Jonathan Pryce (The Two Popes)<br>Leonardo Dicaprio (Once Upon a Time...)</td>
      <td>Joaquin Phoenix (Joker)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Best Lead Actress</td>
      <td>Charlize Theron (Bombshell)<br>Cynthia Erivo (Harriet)<br>Renée Zellweger (Judy)<br>Saoirse Ronan (Little Women)<br>Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story)</td>
      <td>Saoirse Ronan (Little Women)</td>

      <td>Best Supporting Actor</td>

      <td>Joe Pesci (The Irishman)</td>

      <td>Florence Pugh (Little Women)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Best Directing</td>
      <td>Bong Joon Ho (Parasite)<br>Martin Scorsese (The Irishman)<br>Quentin Tarantino (Once upon a time...)<br>Sam Mendes (1917)<br>Todd Phillips (Joker)</td>
      <td>Martin Scorsese (The Irishman)<p>*It's a SHAM that Lulu Wang was not nominated for The Farewell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Best original score</td>
      <td>Thomas Newman (1917)<br>Hildur Guðnadóttir (Joker)<br>Alexandre Desplat (Little Women)<br>Randy Newman (Marriage Story)<br>John Williams (Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker)</td>
      <td>Hildur Guðnadóttir (Joker)</td>
  </table><p>

So, yeah. Not including a wide number of categories that are just less interesting to me either because I don't particularly care about them, or because I haven't<br>
seen enough titles in them to make a valid call. I will say that the SNUB OF THE YEAR award goes to the academy awards for not fucking nominating The Farewell for<br>
<em>anything</em>, as well as not nominating Willem Dafoe for The Lighthouse. All this said, my personal top 10 list of 2019 goes like this:<p>

  1. The Joker<br>
  2. The Lighthouse <br>
  3. The Irishman<br>
  4. The Farewell<br>
  5. Parasite<br>
  6. 1917<br>
  7. Little Women<br>
  8. Dolor y gloria (Pain and Glory)<br>
  9. Paddleton<br>
  10. The Gangster, the Cop, the Devil<p>

    Elisson out.
