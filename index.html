This is "Edelisson", my personal website. It consists of my blog; where I will (randomly) post stuff pertaining to my life.<br>
Under Archival Science you will find things regarding archives, such as news, scientific studies, literature, thoughts.<br>
This is of particular interest as I am a student of it, and an aspiring archivist.<br>
In "Free Culture" you will find my own free creative output mostly under the artistic umbrella of music.<br>
Included therein will be project files, text documents with lyrics and notes, and everything for full artistic transparency.<br>
Under links you will find links to particular sites of interest, including to certain blog posts on this website,<br>
but for the most part outside of it. "About" should be pretty self explanatory. The website is constantly under development.<br>
