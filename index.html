Welcome to EdElisson, my personal website. It consists of my blog; where I will post random stuff.<br>
Under Archival Science you may find links to (mostly) recent as well as key texts and issues regarding archival science.<br>
In "Free Culture" you will find my own creative output in music, including project files.<br>
Under links you will find links to particular sites of interest, including to certain blog posts on this website,<br>
but for the most part outside of it. "About" should be pretty self explanatory. This is pretty much constantly under construction.<br>
